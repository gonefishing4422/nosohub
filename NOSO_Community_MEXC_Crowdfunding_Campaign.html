    <h1>NOSO Community MEXC Crowdfunding Campaign</h1>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <h2>Current Exchange Situation</h2>
    <p>Our current exchange platforms offer a feasible means for trading Noso. However, given their relatively recent establishment, many individuals harbor reservations about entrusting their funds to these platforms. There is a growing demand for a more reliable and professional exchange to facilitate NOSO trading, one that instills a higher degree of trust and accessibility among the community.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <h2>New Exchange Options:</h2>
    <p>In recent months, the NOSO marketing team has diligently explored various exchange options to cater to our community's needs. We've engaged in discussions with official representatives from exchanges like MEXC, Gate.io, and KuCoin to comprehensively assess their listing requirements and associated fees for incorporating Noso on their platforms. While these exchanges can be expensive, with some necessitating legal opinions and contractual obligations that might pose challenges during our project's early stages, we have identified a suitable exchange that aligns with the NOSO community's requirements. This exchange is MEXC.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <h2>Listing Requirements for MEXC:</h2>
    <p>In our sincere efforts to secure the best possible deal with MEXC, we initially drew inspiration from listing fees and requirements shared by other projects already featured on the exchange. While we couldn't achieve our ideal terms, we did manage to secure certain concessions regarding fees and requirements. It's worth noting that each listed project is subject to a unique fee structure and set of requirements. The final deal we've negotiated with MEXC is as follows:</p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <h2>Total Fees:</h2>
    <p><b>$120,000 USDT Listing Fee, which breaks down as follows:</b></p>

    <ul>
      <li>$30,000 USDT paid directly to MEXC</li>
      <li>$30,000 USDT worth of NOSO (earmarked for executing marketing campaigns and events, with full distribution to users)</li>
      <li>$30,000 USDT for Market Making</li>
      <li>$30,000 USDT worth of NOSO for Market Making</li>
    </ul>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <h2>Why Should the Community Contribute?</h2>
    <p>The NOSO community has been unequivocal in its call for a higher-tier exchange. As a community-driven project launched without an ICO, we all recognize the intrinsic value and potential of Noso. We appreciate the necessity for a superior exchange where everyone can securely buy and sell Noso. We appeal to our community to come together and raise the funds needed to help our project reach its full potential.</p>

    <p>Given the size of our community, achieving this goal should be readily attainable, paving the way for the desired listing. Transitioning to a new, larger exchange is expected to validate Noso's worth to prospective community members, attracting new investors who may have hesitated to participate on a third-tier exchange. This expansion will benefit both Noso's user base and your investment. We are optimistic that our community will be motivated and enthusiastic about uniting to make this endeavor a reality.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <h2>How Will the Community Fund Be Managed?</h2>
    <p>The donation wallets will be overseen by one of our dedicated leaders, GoneFishing, who has been an integral part of the Noso team since 2021. Once the total funds are gathered, GoneFishing will collaborate directly with MEXC to facilitate the fund transfer and facilitate Noso's integration onto the new exchange. While the timeline for each implementation can vary, we estimate that the listing should occur within a few weeks after the funds are provided to MEXC.</p>

    <p>Any surplus funds received will be allocated to Noso's growth plan.</p>
